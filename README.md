# Calculator Application

This is a GUI-based calculator application built using Python's `Tkinter` library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations as well as some advanced scientific calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), Division (÷).
- **Scientific Functions**: Trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (lg, ln), exponentiation, square roots, and more.
- **Support for Constants**: Includes constants such as Pi (π) and Euler's number (e).
- **Degree/Radian Mode**: Toggle between degree and radian modes for trigonometric functions.
- **Second Functionality**: Switch to inverse trigonometric functions (sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹) using the "2nd" button.
- **Special Operations**: Factorial (!), square root (√), and percentage calculation.
- **Customizable Display**: The output is formatted with thousands separators for better readability.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) .
  
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter


## Usage
Click on the buttons to input numbers and operators.
Use the "AC" button to clear the current input.
Use the "DEL" button to delete the last entered character.
Press the "2nd" button to toggle between normal and inverse trigonometric functions.
Switch between degree and radian mode using the "deg/rad" button.

### Example Calculations

Basic Arithmetic:
2 + 2 = 4
5 ÷ 2 = 2.5

Trigonometric Functions:
sin(30) in degree mode will give 0.5.
cos(π) will give -1.

Exponentiation:
2^3 = 8

Square Root:
√16 = 4
