# Calculator Application

This is a GUI-based calculator application built using Python's `Tkinter` library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations as well as some advanced scientific calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), Division (÷).
- **Scientific Functions**: Trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (lg, ln), exponentiation, square roots, and more.
- **Support for Constants**: Includes constants such as Pi (π) and Euler's number (e).
- **Degree/Radian Mode**: Toggle between degree and radian modes for trigonometric functions.
- **Second Functionality**: Switch to inverse trigonometric functions (sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹) using the "2nd" button.
- **Special Operations**: Factorial (!), square root (√), and percentage calculation.
- **Customizable Display**: The output is formatted with thousands separators for better readability.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
  
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   
## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the Python file.
  
2. Run the calculator.py file using the following command:
   ```bash
     python calculator.py
   
The calculator window will open, and you can start using the application.

## Usage
Click on the buttons to input numbers and operators.
Use the "AC" button to clear the current input.
Use the "⌫" button to delete the last entered character.
Press the "2nd" button to toggle between normal and inverse trigonometric functions.
Switch between degree and radian mode using the "deg/rad" button.

### Example Calculations

Basic Arithmetic:
2 + 2 = 4
5 ÷ 2 = 2.5

Trigonometric Functions:
sin(30) in degree mode will give 0.5.
cos(π) will give -1.

Exponentiation:
2^3 = 8

Square Root:
√16 = 4
3√7 = 7,93..
